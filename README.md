## Single cell RNA sequencing of the medial Amygdala of mice to determine sex and parenting characteristics  
With the use of advanced data manipulation pipeline (code attached), we found that the GABAergic neurons of the Amyg-
dala area have different levels of gene expression between females,
males, parents, and na ̈ıve mice. 
Meaning, by analysing GABAergic genes we can determine the sex and parenting characteristics in mice
